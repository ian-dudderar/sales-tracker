Next.JS Application with a custom HTTP server to handle socket.io

'npm install' to install necessary packages
'npm run dev' to run

This application was created as a fun side project per request of a friend of mine, so that she would be able to track
her shopify website's sales goal for black friday. It will provide real-time sales updates via shopify webhooks, as well as
a progress bar based on the users daily sales goal (eastern time for day sales reset)

Requires shopify admin API access, along with the API key, API secret, and an Access Token.

See the env.example file for necessary enviornment variables.
