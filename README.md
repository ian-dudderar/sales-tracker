Next.JS Application with a custom HTTP server to handle socket.io

'npm install' to install necessary packages
'npm run dev' to run

This application was created as a fun side project per request of a friend of mine, so that she would be able to track
her shopify website's sales goal for black friday.

Requires shopify admin API access, along with the API key, API secret, and an Access Token.

See the env.example file for necessary enviornment variables.
